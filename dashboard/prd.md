Make a simple streamlit dashboard that displays a stacked bar chart of licenses by zipcode and alcohol type

place the app in /dashboard directory
we use uv to manage dependencies
and there is a .venv directory that is already set up

use data from data/licenses.xlsx
fields zipcode and alcohol_type

provide a way to adjust the start and end dates of the data displayed
using minutes_date field

and select only granted licenses that is field status == 'granted'

this should the the initial design with the expectation that the app will be expanded in the future
